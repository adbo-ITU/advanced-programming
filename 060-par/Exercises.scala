   * Test case could be to have a side effect (such as print) within the
   * mapper function f, use map (but NOT run it), check that the side
   * effect has not been applied, then run the Par, and then check that
   * it has been applied.
   *
   * Alternatively, you could check that it is being run in parallel and
   * not blocking the current thread. For example, run an expensive task,
   * then make sure the main thread can keep going while map is running.

   * My solution obtains concurrency by using parMap. Inside parMap, each
   * item of the list is turned into an parallel task (via lazyUnit),
   * meaning the mappers (sending the requests) are running in parallel
   * and not blocking each other, assuming enouch threads are available
   * in the pool.
   *
   * Parallel runs in 320 ms most of the time. Non-parallel is 420-700ms. So
   * definitely a difference. Test:
